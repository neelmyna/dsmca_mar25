Ways to Link Bootstrap to our html (webpage)

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">

1.Copy the URL in the Link tag (above) and paste it in the browser. Now copy the Pretty Print Source code. Paste it in notepad++ and save the file as bootstrap.min.css inside assests folder inside learning folder.

Now we can link this file into our html and enable our html with bootstrap.

2. Just add the bootstrap CDN (link tag) in our html inside head tag.
However, to use bootstrap using the CDN, there must internet available.
